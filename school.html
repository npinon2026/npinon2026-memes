      <p>To the subject examinations that include calculations, looking at you Math, Physics, Chemistry. Please have pity on my poor brain 
        that has suffered from 2 years of neglect and procrastination.

      <p>Inspiration and motivation goes to 0 when faced with dues and requirements. If only a certain someone were to return to my life then maybe I'd have the 
        willpower to do everything all at once. Until then, I'll be doing my reqs on the day it dues.

      <p>It has to be even and exact, that's just an unwritten rule. No one knows what'll happen if you'll get against it and no one dares to try 
        test it. I'd rather just do it at 7:30 to be honest.

      <p>All is well that ends well, pressing that submit button at the ripe time of 3:00 makes finishing the due all the more satisfying. Nevermind the eyebugs, 
        oily skin, and almost dying mental health. All is well.

      <p>I wouldn't mind if this were to happen, but in all honesty, if I just had the mental capacity to care enough I'd be bawling my eyes out. That being said, I have no idea if 
        those tears would be for joy, sadness, or just because of the lack of sleep.

      <p>How can I be all but number 1? Take my physics exam as an example, 5 minutes in and I just went and calculated what the passing score would be because believe me, I knew 
        I failed.
